README
======

Cliff notes version of the readme:

1. No official licensing (i.e. GPL, BSD, etc). Basically I am providing this as copyfree so you don't have to contribute back. Just don't claim original source code as yours or sue me over using this repository.

2. No Warranty. You assume all risk for using these. I am NOT responsible for data loss, corruption or anything else that happens as a result of you using these files for your own use. Make sure that you back everything up.

Why C and Other Systems programming?
====================================

First off, I am well aware shell scripting exists. And I have done it before. Shell scripting could solve 90% of the stuff in these repositories just fine. Those will be coming later as I have gotten the basic ideas down.

Shell scripting would fix and be easier to use for the vast majority of these simple tasks. And could more readily imported into the /usr/bin (or wherever the binaries or scripts exist on your system). 

Second, I wanted to get into using C,C++, and Rust programming. I wanted to create some basic programs first and work my way up into more complex examples in the repositories. You have to crawl before you work your way up.

There is also a method to the madness-eventually I would like to interface many of the C files in a C++ GUI frontend. Until then, I am just trying to get a few of the basics that I need down and organized according to what operating system that they are on. 

Third, this is not a ChatGPT experiment. I understand they are simple and seem like they are a spoof on actual usable code compared to what is actually in the source tree. I am keeping what I can simple on purpose so I can create some references for myself as I build my knowlesge of these kinds of programming up to more complex situations.

So why no readmes in the base folders?
======================================

I have tried to title the files to allude to what they are supposed to be doing. For example, openbsd_vmm_setup.c is the C file that you can use towards setting up some basic virtual machines on OpenBSD. I have tried to make it simple to deduce what is going on.

FAQ
===

1. Why copyfree?

First off, I can understand different licensing needs. Different licenses serve their purposes and I am not here to argue for the best license. Different strokes for different folks.

Second off, I don't want to have to manage contributions back. These are largely simple files that can easily be modified or adapted. Copyfree allows a variety of non-Linux or non-illumos/Solaris like systems to integrate these into their systems without fear of legal action. Copyfree makes it easy to get adoption.

2. Why target certain operating systems?

Because I can and I am interested in these particular systems. And I would to at least try to contribute back even if the developers never officially incorporate the files into their systems.
