FAQ
===

1. Why copyfree?

First off, I can understand different licensing needs. Different licenses serve their purposes and I am not here to argue for the best license. Different strokes for different folks.

Second off, I don't want to have to manage contributions back. These are largely simple files that can easily be modified or adapted. Copyfree allows a variety of non-Linux or non-illumos/Solaris like systems to integrate these into their systems without fear of legal action. Copyfree makes it easy to get adoption.

2. Why target certain operating systems?

Because I can and I am interested in these particular systems. And I would to at least try to contribute back even if the developers never officially incorporate the files into their systems.
